# Pyber-Analysis
## Overview 
This analysis visualizes the total week fares by city type for PyBer using Matplotlib and Pandas. A multiple-line graph displays the total week fares for the dates 01/01/2019 to 04/28/2019 for each city type; Rural, Suburban, and Urban. 

## Results 
The summary DataFrame demonstrates that the Rural city type has the least amount of rides and drivers, but has the highest average fare per ride and driver. On the other hand, the Urban city type demonstrates the opposite, it has more drivers and rides, and lower avergae fares per ride and driver. The Suburban city type data calculates between these two other city types.

The line chart show that the Urban city type consistently had the highest total fares, followed by the Suburban city type, and lastly, the the Rural city type had the lowest total fares for the period of time between 01/01/2019 to 04/28/2019.

## Summary 
The summary DataFrame demonstrates that while the Rural city type does not have enough drivers, the Urban city type has too many drivers. These drivers can be reallocated to Rural areas, hopefully making it easier to find rides. Having more drivers will reduce the average fare per driver, making it more economical to ride, encouraging more traffic in these areas. Another way to avoid falling into the pattern of having not enough drivers and therefore increasing the average fare per ride is to put a cap on the ride fare. If the people in these areas know that their ride will never be more than a certain amount, they might be more likely to use to the ride-sharing service, driving other drivers and users to that area and increasing the company's overall traffic.
